I am a second-year PhD student in Psychology at Harvard University.

My work is bi-directional. On one end, I combine behavioral experiments and computational modeling to study how people metacognitively evaluate information, intentions, and intelligence in digital environments. On the other, I am quite interested in exploring what aspects of human cognition have seeped into the weights of AI, especially LLMs, and how aligned they are with human behaviors.
