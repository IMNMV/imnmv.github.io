On one end, I combine behavioral experiments and computational modeling to study how people metacognitively evaluate information, intentions, and intelligence in digital environments. On the other, I am quite interested in exploring what aspects of human cognition have seeped into the weights of AI, especially LLMs, and how aligned they are with human behaviors.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Focus\nHuman-AI interaction and belief updating during uncertainty & Reasoning inconsistencies in LLMs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR MCP integration for interactive, agent-assisted coding in RStudio.
